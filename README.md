# Tic Tac Toe

This is the 4th project for the team treehouse techdegree as a javascript full stack developer.

See [requirements](Documentation/Requirements.md) for the instructions.

The folder "Provided-Files" contains the files like teamtreehouse provided them for the project.

You might also be interested in my [notes](Documentation/Notes.md) where I share my thoughts about why I chose one way of solution over another.

In a nutshell, this project is about creating a tic-tac-toe game. A game that shall be playable
against another person on the computer or a computer agent. Treehouse provided a few links and 
some nice styling and a few awesome UI mockups.


I try to become better at measuring and guessing time. For an insight into what I did and how long it took you may have fun looking at my [pomodoro-log](Documentation/Pomodoro-Log.md).
