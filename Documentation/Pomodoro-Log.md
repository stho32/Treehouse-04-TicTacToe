# Pomodoro-Log

1. Repository setup
1. Documentation of the projects requirements
1. Added jquery, added new code file, finished R1 and started R2
1. new player "class" to control player ui independently, experiments with the styles and the ui to understand what is needed to make the ui work and what is already there
1. Css experiments have been converted into proper classes, the player class now makes sure that the hover effect matches the active player, the new class "Gameboard" contains the first interactions on game level
1. I want to enable human and computer players... structuring source code... players now know if they are human or computers...
1. full human interaction now works, even with a few bug fixes for visual styles
1. lost control a bit.. 
1. now I can detect wins and ties, tell who won and stuff. 
1. Interaction with the final screen
1. (01:48 h) Refactored everything with a SceneManager... :) 
1. (01:32 h) Now the player is asked for a name. Actually you can enter a name for both players _and_ you can tell the game that it is a human or computer player. The information is passed on to the gameboard to be displayed and used in the interaction.
1. (01:33h) Added new directory "Source-AI", a new small separate space only for the development of the ai containing unit tests as well. Added tests for supportive functions. Basic move-permutation works. The ai does not yet, but so close, so close...
1. (00:58h) Unit Tests complete for now, AI looks like its working separatly.
1. (00:50h) Integrated AI, test games, checking off requirements, last fixes...
